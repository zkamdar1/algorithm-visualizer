# Algorithm Visualizer

## Introduction

Algorithm Visualizer is a web application designed to help you understand and visualize various pathfinding and sorting algorithms. By providing interactive visualizations, this tool aims to make learning algorithms easier and more intuitive.

## Features

- Visualize pathfinding algorithms like Dijkstra, A*, BFS, and DFS.
- Visualize sorting algorithms like Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort, and Insertion Sort.
- Interactive controls to step through algorithms and adjust parameters.
- Working on adding BFS, DFS, and sorting algos.

## Installation
